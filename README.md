## Introduction
Shield.ai is a leading company in the development of AI technologies for defense and security. This project explores the company's technological advancements, business model, and the implications of its AI solutions on modern warfare.

## Origin
The Idea for this company started with a simple thought from a former Navy Seal "What would the military of 2030 would look like and what role does autonomy play?." The answer they reached - AI pilots powering every military assert: aircraft, drones, ships, satellites and submarines. The Defense Industry at that time was lacking in talent to achieve that goal. This presented an opportunity to start fresh and build the aerospace and defense technology company of the 21st century focused on AI pilots. In 2015, Brandon Tseng (Navy Seal), Ryan Tseng and Andrew Reiter founded Shield AI, with their HQ at San Diego, California. The company started as any other startups moving up pre-seed funding to Series F funding. As of writing of this article Shield AI is a Venture Capital-Backed company. Some of the Investors of Shield AI include Alpha Partners, ARK Venture Fund, Brave Capital (San Francisco), Calm ventures.

The AI developed by the company has been named HIVEMIND - best-in-class autonomy stack for aircraft and is combat tested, safe, modular, and human-directable.

These AI Pilot designed by Shield AI have a 99% win rate against simulated F-16 digfights verse active-duty fighter pilots. According to the company Hivemind its AI can perform a different missions from Beyond Visual Range of enemies air suppression systems. Hivemind will be deployed as a co-pilot on U.S.Air Force F-16, with a goal of scaling next-generation aircrafts. The company is looking into adding Hivemind as a co-polit for F-22s, and F-18s. According to Mark Esper, Former Secretary of Defense "whichever nation harnesses AI first will have decisive advantage on the battlefield for many years." One of the main feature of Hivemind is SensAI which enchances lefacy hardware and optimizes sensors for dynamic targeting. After countless tests as a Digital Co-Pilot, the company moving towards Man-Unmanned Team testing. This might be a game changer since a single pilot can be deployed with multiple UAVs who act as a team with human pilot to execute mission with incresed rate of success.


## Lanscape
In the Defense space there are always new innovations and a constant competition between multiple companies in the race to securing an advantage over the enemies. Shield AI is one of many companies who are competing in the AI space for the DOD. Some of the notable competitors are Skydio, Anduril Industries, AeroVironment, Flyability and Exyn. Sheild AI has a edge over these competitors with wide range of products with are compact, cost effective, versitile and a proven record of it use on the battlefield.
