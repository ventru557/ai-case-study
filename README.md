## Introduction
Shield.ai is a leading company in the development of AI technologies for defense and security. This project explores the company's technological advancements, business model, and the implications of its AI solutions on modern warfare.

## Origin
The Idea for this company started with a simple thought from a former Navy Seal "What would the military of 2030 would look like and what role does autonomy play?." The answer they reached - AI pilots powering every military assert: aircraft, drones, ships, satellites and submarines. The Defense Industry at that time was lacking in talent to achieve that goal. This presented an opportunity to start fresh and build the aerospace and defense technology company of the 21st century focused on AI pilots. In 2015, Brandon Tseng (Navy Seal), Ryan Tseng and Andrew Reiter founded Shield AI, with their HQ at San Diego, California. The company started as any other startups moving up pre-seed funding to Series F funding. As of writing of this article Shield AI is a Venture Capital-Backed company. Some of the Investors of Shield AI include Alpha Partners, ARK Venture Fund, Brave Capital (San Francisco), Calm ventures.

The AI developed by the company has been named HIVEMIND - best-in-class autonomy stack for aircraft and is combat tested, safe, modular, and human-directable.  

## Business Activities

### NOVA 2
Shield AI has mutiple products at their disposal ranging from drones to AI pilots. NOVA was the first product they have release, its a drone equipped with vision and thermal sensors, which can autonomously navigate complex subterranean and multi-story structures without GPS, comms or a human pilot. This product has been deployed in combat missions and has proven to be a great asset. Both US and Israeli forces have named NOVA 2 (second itiration on NOVA) as "most mission capable indoor drone" in the world. 
NOVA 2 features: Day/Night Autonomy, GPS Denied Flight, Thermal Camera, Comms Link Denied Flight, Bounding Box Exploration, Payload Ready, Person Detection & Localization and Software Updates.

### V-BAT
A vertical take-off and landing drone with a landing zones as small as 12' X 12' , with a wide range of interchangeable and customizable payloads options. The most tactical, most logistically simple UAS in the world. The only and major difference between V-BAT and other VTOL aircraft is the design with allows increases in thrust by 80% with a single power plant. This design allows V-BAT to fly for half day or stop and hover for hours on end. Another advantage is V-BAT is fully deployable by a 2-person team in 20 minutes, fits in the back of pickup truck or UH-60 Blackhawk. V-BAT right now are used by US Coast Guard to monitor seas.
V-BAT Specs: Wing Span: 9.7ft, Length: 9ft, Weight: 125lbs, Endurance: 10 hrs, Landing Zone: 12ft X 12ft, Payload Capacity: 25lbs, Hover-To-Flight < 15secs, Service Ceiling: 20,000 ft
